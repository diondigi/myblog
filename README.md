NEW test blog version

2018.2.4 Now Do an exercise program, personal blog. Many of the features are not perfect, and you need to build up the
framework step by step, and then optimize the details.

2018.2.7 Recent attempts have been made to optimize some features, such as search and RSS aggregation. I looked up a lot of source code and found that the understanding is still a lot worse. Maybe it's not enough for Python, but I want to keep up with it.
